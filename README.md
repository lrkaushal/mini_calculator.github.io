Mini Calculator Project with GUI - README
This project is a mini calculator implemented in Java with a graphical user interface (GUI). It allows users to perform basic arithmetic operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division on two input numbers using a graphical interface.

Features
Addition: Performs the addition operation on two numbers.
Subtraction: Performs the subtraction operation on two numbers.
Multiplication: Performs the multiplication operation on two numbers.
Division: Performs the division operation on two numbers.
Prerequisites
Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your system.
Basic understanding of Java programming language.
Familiarity with GUI programming in Java (e.g., Swing or JavaFX).
